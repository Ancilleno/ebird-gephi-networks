#This code chunk specifies the species I will be focusing on for my work.

# DASSpecies are Detroit Audubon society Species are 20 species 
#that were selected by Detroit Audubon society because they visit both the Bahamas and 
#the Detroit River Valley.
#The species are mentioned in their proposal to create an educational program 
#for youth in the Bahamas and Detroit that highlights this connection.

#BAH Species are 16 species including those species identified by Lloyd and Slater (2011) 
#as breeding in the Bahamas and 5 Bahamian endemics which occur on the island of Grand Bahama
#and Common Ground-Doves, Northern Mockingbirds and Red-legged Thrushes, which are fairly common and easily identified.
